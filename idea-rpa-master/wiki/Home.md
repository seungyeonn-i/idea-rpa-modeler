## API documentation

The OpenApi documentation of the offered API can be found when fetching the `/docs` route from the running backend, which is up to date with everything in the Code, as it is generated at runtime.
WHen running a local version of the software you can access the documentation using `localhost:5000/docs`

## How to contribute to the wiki

To contribute a page to the wiki, please create a markdown file in the `/wiki` directory or edit an existing one. It will automatically be deployed as a wiki page once it is pushed onto the DEV branch.  
The page title will have the same name as the filename of your created file and will show hyphens as empty spaces. Therefore, we ask you to not use empty spaces in your filenames.

> The deployment of wiki pages will overwrite the existing pages, so if you want to persist your article in the wiki, please go the route of creating a markdown file.
